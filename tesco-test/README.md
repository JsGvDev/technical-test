# Tesco app-test

This app is for testing my knowledge with framework angularJS. Due to Constant Commerce copyright, these files are not upload in a public repository.

##Dependencies

nodejs and npm --> https://nodejs.org/en/download/

##Getting started:

If you don't have nodejs and npm, first you have to install it (above you have the link, npm include when you install nodejs)

Now, you can install this app-test, only you need to unzip (tesco-app.zip) in your workspace. Then you open your shell or cmd

`cd "path at your workspace"/tesco-app`
`npm install`

##Tests

`npm run test`
